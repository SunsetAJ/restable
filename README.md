# Restable
### Note: this plugin is still under development.
jQuery plugin to make tables responsive. **JQUERY IS REQUIRED**

<h3>Details</h3>
This is a simple plugin to make `<table>` elements responsive.
It works by reconstructing the markup to use list items instead. with a little bit of CSS magic your tables will now be responsive.

<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
The plugin is still very much under development, it does not support all forms of table layouts.
A new layout has been added to the support in version 0.2
```html
<!-- Layout 1 -->
<table>
  <caption>Table Caption</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Table heading</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table Content</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<!-- Layout 2 -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Heading</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Content</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Currently the plugin can only handle this style of structure.

<h3>HOW TO USE</h3>
Once the plugin has been downloaded (js & css), and linked in your web project.
Simply use the code below to use the function
```JavaScript
 $('table').restable();
```
There is also some settings that can be added
```JavaScript
 $('table').restable({
  caption : true //Default is false
  caption_text : 'New Caption' //Default is null
 });
```
- **caption** : This will look for the `<caption>` element and display text at the top of the page.
- **caption_text** : This will override the `<caption>` element.

<h3>Changing CSS in your style.css file</h3>
The plugin will assign a id to each of the tables to make it easier to target specific tables as well as remove any conflict that the plugin may have with your css files.
To target all the tables generated by Restable use the following statement in your CSS
```
[id*="restable-table-"]{
  /* Your styling */
}
```
